# Frontend Design Skill for Cursor

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic aesthetics.

## When to Apply

Apply this skill when:
- Building UI components, pages, or complete interfaces
- The user requests frontend development work
- Creating visual designs that require aesthetic decisions

## Design Thinking Process

Before coding, commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

### 1. Understand Context
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an aesthetic direction (brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian)
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

### 2. Implementation Standards

Generate code that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose beautiful, unique, interesting fonts
- Avoid generic fonts: Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts
- Use distinctive display fonts paired with refined body fonts

### Color & Theme
- Commit to cohesive aesthetics using CSS variables
- Dominant colors with sharp accents
- Avoid timid, evenly-distributed palettes

### Motion & Animations
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Create well-orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals
- Use scroll-triggering and surprising hover states

### Spatial Composition
- Create unexpected layouts with asymmetry
- Use overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements
- Balance generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth (not solid colors)
- Use gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Add layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders
- Consider custom cursors and grain overlays

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

NEVER use:
- Overused fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts
- Cliched color schemes: purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character
- Common choices like Space Grotesk across projects

## Key Principles

- Choose clear conceptual direction and execute with precision
- Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision
- Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations
- Minimalist designs need restraint and careful attention to details
- No two designs should be the same
- Vary between light/dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics
- Think outside the box and commit fully to distinctive visions
