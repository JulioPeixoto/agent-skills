# Frontend Design Instructions for GitHub Copilot

This configuration guides GitHub Copilot to create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic aesthetics.

## Core Principles

When generating frontend code, follow these guidelines:

### Design Thinking

Before suggesting code, consider:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Choose a clear aesthetic direction (minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, editorial, brutalist, art deco, soft/pastel, industrial, etc.)
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- **Differentiation**: What makes this memorable and unique?

### Implementation Guidelines

Generate code that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

### Frontend Aesthetics

Focus on:

#### Typography
- Choose distinctive fonts that elevate aesthetics
- Avoid generic fonts like Arial, Inter, Roboto
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

#### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic with CSS variables
- Use dominant colors with sharp accents
- Avoid timid, evenly-distributed palettes

#### Motion & Animations
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions
- Create well-orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals
- Use scroll-triggering and surprising hover states

#### Spatial Composition
- Create unexpected layouts with asymmetry
- Use overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements
- Balance generous negative space OR controlled density

#### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth
- Use gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Add layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders

### What to Avoid

NEVER suggest:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

### Variety & Creativity

- No two designs should be the same
- Vary between light and dark themes
- Use different fonts and aesthetics for each project
- Match implementation complexity to aesthetic vision
- Think outside the box and commit to distinctive visions
