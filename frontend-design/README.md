# Frontend Design Skill

Generates distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics.

## What It Does

This skill guides AI agents to create production-ready code with:

- Bold aesthetic choices
- Distinctive typography and color palettes
- High-impact animations and visual details
- Context-aware implementation

## Compatible Platforms

- Claude (Anthropic)
- Cursor (AI IDE)
- GitHub Copilot

## Usage

Examples of prompts:

```
"Create a dashboard for a music streaming app"

```

The AI assistant will choose a clear aesthetic direction and implement production code with meticulous attention to detail.
