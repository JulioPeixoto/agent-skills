# Code Review Skill for Cursor

## When to Apply

Apply this skill when:
- Reviewing code changes or pull requests
- User asks to review code, find bugs, or check compliance
- Analyzing code quality before commit

## Review Process

### 1. Initial Check

Before reviewing, verify:
- Is this a meaningful change worth reviewing?
- Are there project guidelines to check (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)?
- What is the intent of these changes?

### 2. Multi-Angle Analysis

Review from these perspectives:

#### Guideline Compliance
- Check adherence to CLAUDE.md and project guidelines
- Verify naming conventions and code style
- Ensure architectural patterns are followed
- Only flag violations of documented rules

#### Bug Detection
- Syntax errors and type mismatches
- Logic errors in conditionals and loops
- Null/undefined handling issues
- Resource leaks (memory, connections)
- Missing error handling

#### Code Quality
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance concerns
- API misuse
- Edge case handling

### 3. Confidence Scoring

Rate each issue 0-100 for confidence:
- 0-25: Low confidence, likely false positive
- 26-50: Moderate, might be real
- 51-75: High confidence, probably real
- 76-100: Very high confidence, definitely real

**Only report issues with confidence ≥ 80**

### 4. High Signal Focus

**DO flag:**
- Syntax/type errors, missing imports
- Clear logic errors producing wrong results
- Unambiguous guideline violations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Resource leaks
- Missing critical error handling

**DO NOT flag:**
- Style preferences (unless in guidelines)
- Subjective suggestions
- Nitpicks that don't matter
- Issues linters catch
- Pre-existing problems
- Potential issues depending on unknown state

### 5. Report Format

For each issue:

```
### Issue: [Brief Title]
Confidence: [85]/100
Category: [Bug/Guideline/Security/Performance]

Problem: [Clear explanation]
Location: file.ext:L10-L15
Evidence: [Quote problematic code]
Guideline: [If applicable, quote rule]
Fix: [Concrete solution]
```

### False Positive Prevention

Never flag:
- Pre-existing issues not in these changes
- Code that looks wrong but is correct
- Pedantic nitpicks
- General quality unless required by guidelines
- Issues with suppression comments

### Best Practices

1. Read project guidelines first
2. Be specific with line numbers and files
3. Explain why something is an issue
4. Suggest concrete fixes
5. Focus on critical issues
6. Consider the change's intent
7. Avoid nitpicking
8. Verify before flagging
